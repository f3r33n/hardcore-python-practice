'''✅ Use this one regularly — every time you update your code:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Added new practice files"
git push
git add . → Adds all your changed files.

git commit -m "..." → Saves a checkpoint with a message.

git push → Uploads it to GitHub.

This is your daily routine.



git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with W3Schools code"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
This longer version is used only ONCE when:

You're pushing the code to GitHub for the first time

You just created a new repo

Your folder is not yet connected to GitHub
